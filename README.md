# Sprite Manipulation and Animation with Pygame

This project is a learning exercise focused on manipulating and animating sprites using **Pygame**, a Python library for game development. The project uses free sprites sourced from **[Craftpix.net](https://craftpix.net/)** to demonstrate basic techniques in sprite animation, movement, and attack implementation.

## Features

- **Smooth Character Movement**: The character can move left and right across the screen, with directional animations.
- **Idle and Running Animations**: The sprite switches between idle and running states based on player input.
- **Attack Animations**: Three unique attack animations (`Attack_1`, `Attack_2`, `Attack_3`) triggered using the `J`, `K`, and `L` keys.
- **Directional Facing**: The character's sprite flips horizontally based on movement direction.
- **Frame-by-Frame Animation**: Demonstrates handling multiple animation states and transitioning between them.
